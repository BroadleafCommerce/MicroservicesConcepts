== Description:

Alters the complex field example to leverage a traditional JPA OneToMany associated collection. The relates to a new table in the database, rather than serializing to JSON.

== Goals:

- Show table based complex field support in the JpaProduct extension
- Demonstrate custom mapping to/from projection
- Demonstrate special `@ProjectionPostConvert` support for setting bi-directional references
- Show supporting admin customization
- Builds On : _00200-productExtensionComplexFieldJson_

== Key Steps:

include::../doc/caveats.adoc[]

- Create spring boot autoconfiguration class `ProductExtensionComplexFieldTableBased`, which will be referenced from META-INF/spring.factories
- Create MyAutoCoProduct repository domain class extending Broadleaf's JpaProduct
- Create Upgrade repository domain class, which will serve as a OneToMany collection member
- Add new OneToMany JPA collection field to MyAutoCoProduct
- Create MyAutoCoProductProjection class extending Broadleaf's Product
- Implement `getBusinessDomainType(..)` in the domain class
- Implement `toMe(..)` and `fromMe(..)` in the domain class
  * Use `MappingUtils.setupExtensions(..)` to setup the extension mapping with the converter
- Annotate method in Upgrade with `@ProjectionPostConvert` to handle bi-direction reference back to MyAutoCoProduct
- Add `JpaEntityScan` annotation to autoconfiguration class above for new extended entity class
- Add `AutoConfigureBefore(..)` annotation to autoconfiguration class above to make sure the entity reference is scanned before JPA processing
