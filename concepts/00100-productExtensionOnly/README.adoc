== Description:

Simple extension of `JpaProduct` adding only a basic field type. Also leverages auto projection, rather than opting for an explicit extended projection.

== Goals:

- Demonstrate the simplest type of extension
- Introduce the `Projection` interface
- Show full lifecycle support (json in/out) for the endpoint API
- Show supporting admin customization
- Show automated testing and the use of `@TestCatalogRouted` (et al.) to handle datarouting requirements during the test

== Key Steps:

- Create spring boot autoconfiguration class `ProductExtensionOnly`, which will be referenced from META-INF/spring.factories
- Create MyAutoCoProduct repository domain class extending Broadleaf's JpaProduct
- Implement new field in MyAutoCoProduct
