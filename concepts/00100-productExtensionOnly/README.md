Description: 

Simple extension of JpaProduct adding only a basic field type. Also leverages auto projection, rather than opting for an explicit extended projection.

Goals:

- Demonstrate the simplest type of extension
- Introduce the Projection interface
- Show full lifecycle support (json in/out) for the endpoint API
- Show supporting admin customization
- Show automated testing and the use of `@TestCatalogRouted` to handle datarouting requirements during the test
