====
`META-INF/spring.factories` is generated automatically as part of the tutorial. However, in a real implementation, this file must be explicitly created and populated.

====
Existing implementations will continue to depend on starter project liquibase support to emit client domain customization changelogs (e.g. `UtilitiesIT` usage). In the future, liquibase changelog generation support will be included as part of the maven build for development projects at large (similar to how it's done in the tutorial concepts).
