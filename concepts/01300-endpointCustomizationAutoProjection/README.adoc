== Description:

Customization of an endpoint method in `ProductEndpoint` leveraging a customized service, repository, auto-projection, and domain

== Goals:

- Demonstrate a behavior tweak of a single endpoint method
- Show leveraging a completely customized flow through to persistence
- Demonstrate working with an auto projection in the endpoint
- Builds On : _01000-businessLogicCustomizationAutoProjection_

== Key Steps:

[NOTE]
====
`META-INF/spring.factories` is generated automatically as part of the tutorial. However, in a real implementation, this file must be explicitly created and populated.
====

[NOTE]
====
Existing implementations will continue to depend on starter project liquibase support to emit client domain customization changelogs (e.g. `UtilitiesIT` usage). In the future, liquibase changelog generation support will be included as part of the maven build for development projects at large (similar to how it's done in the tutorial concepts).
====

- Create spring boot autoconfiguration class `EndpointCustomizationAutoProjection`, which will be referenced from META-INF/spring.factories
- Create new Rest Controller implementation that matches path and HTTP method of an existing endpoint from a Broadleaf framework Rest controller
- Declare the `@ComponentScan` annotation on the autoconfiguration class
- Declare the `@AutoConfigureBefore` annotation on the autoconfiguration class to prioritize your controller endpoint
