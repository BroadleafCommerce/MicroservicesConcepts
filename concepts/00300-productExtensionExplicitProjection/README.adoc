== Description:

Continues with the complex field example persisted as JSON. However, in this case, an explicit projection type is declared.

== Goals:

- Demonstrate custom mapping to/from projection
- Demonstrate response only projection field
- Show supporting admin customization
- Demonstrate mapping to synthetic fields
- Builds On : _00200-productExtensionComplexFieldJson_

== Key Steps:

include::../doc/caveats.adoc[]

- Create spring boot autoconfiguration class `ProductExtensionExplicitProjection`, which will be referenced from META-INF/spring.factories
- Create MyAutoCoProduct repository domain class extending Broadleaf's JpaProduct (see _00200-productExtensionComplexFieldJson_ key steps)
- Create MyAutoCoProductProjection class extending Broadleaf's Product
- Implement `getBusinessDomainType(..)` in the domain class
- Implement `toMe(..)` and `fromMe(..)` in the domain class
   * Leverage a post converter to perform the interesting mapping to/from projection
   * Use `MappingUtils.setupExtensions(..)` to setup the extension mapping with the converter
- Add `JpaEntityScan` annotation to autoconfiguration class above for new extended entity class
- Add `AutoConfigureBefore(..)` annotation to autoconfiguration class above to make sure the entity reference is scanned before JPA processing
