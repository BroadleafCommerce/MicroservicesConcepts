= Microservice Extensibility Concepts

This project contains several example *concepts* demonstrating various extension and backend commerce API developer use-cases.

== Terminology

- *Concept*: A sub-project within this overall project that showcases a discrete customization goal. The goal will be clearly stated in each concept project. Some concept projects will be deeper riffs on concepts from other projects (e.g. a simple domain extension in one project may be built on top of to add additional repository extension in another project).
- *Flex Package*: A Flex Package is a deployment configuration and packaging concept that allows multiple Broadleaf microservices to exist in a single JVM runtime under a single Spring instance. More details can be found https://developer.broadleafcommerce.com/architecture/deployment-flexibility#overview[here]

== Project Guidelines
- The *concept* project structure will be simple. The `Min` flexpackage alone will be generally favored, avoiding `balanced` and `granular` bloat.
- Each *concept* project will consume framework and demo artifacts from the latest relevant `develop` branches.
- Each *concept* project is constructed using the minimal amount of configuration and code for optimum clarity.

== Project Structure

.Project Structure Folders Overview
|===
|Directory |Description

|`concepts`
| Group of runnable projects that demonstrate a key dev or extension experience using the most streamlined approach available.

|`docker`
| Basic docker configuration to support backend of the tutorial runtime. We can consider not having these items in docker and instead have them be launched by java, or similar. If we did that, the goal would be to reduce tooling required to run the tutorial cases.

|`script`
| core build script code that supports all instances of `reset-and-run` and `stop-docker`.

|===

== What Do I Need?
In order to get these `concepts running locally, you will want to obtain and install
the following:

=== Credentials
Access to Broadleaf's Docker Registry and Maven Nexus is needed in order to pull down the
appropriate resources.

Once you have obtained these credentials, you will need to configure them for the dependencies
below.

[NOTE]
====
Contact `info@broadleafcommerce.com` for information on how to receive these credentials
====

=== Java
You will need Java 11 installed on your machine.

=== Docker
You will need to have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker Engine & Docker Compose] installed
locally

[TIP]
====
Docker Desktop for both Mac and Windows already includes compose along with other
docker apps.
====

Once you have docker installed, you will want to authenticate with Broadleaf's docker registry.

Type the following into your CLI:

[source,shell script]
----
docker login repository.broadleafcommerce.com:5001
----

When prompted, type in the username and password you received above.

=== Maven
You'll need to have Maven installed locally as well.
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.5 or later] is recommended.

Once you have maven installed, another step you need to do before you can
build the project is to configure the authentication. Maven requires it to be specified in a
file called `settings.xml` that has to be in the `.m2` subdirectory in a user’s home directory.

1. Create a folder called `.m2` in your home directory
2. Create a file called `settings.xml` in the `.m2` folder
3. Copy the following contents to your `~/.m2/settings.xml` making sure to
replace the credentials with the ones you received above:

[source,xml]
----
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>broadleaf-microservices</id>
      <username>username_here</username>
      <password>password_here</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

[TIP]
====
More info about authenticating with private repositories can be found
https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers[here] and
https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-settings/settings.html[here]
====

== Running a Concept Project
- In the specific concept module, execute the platform specific `reset-and-run` script.

[TIP]
====
`ctrl-c` will terminate the process.
====


- The `stop-docker` script may be used to take down any running container resulting from the `reset-and-run` script.
- The admin application will be accessible at https://localhost:8446 after all components have completed startup.

[TIP]
====
The browser may complain about the self-signed cert and you may have to make an exception for the cert in your browser.
====

== How Does This Work?
- Each concept project creates a jar that is contributed to a standard Broadleaf `Min` flexpackage demo
- The jar is contributed via Spring Boot `auto-configuration`
- When necessary, `@AutoConfigureBefore` and `@AutoConfigureAfter` are employed to favor concept configuration over Broadleaf configuration
- Integration tests are generally employed in each concept to exercise the service API and demonstrate the customization.
- The customizations are generally Catalog service customizations - specifically riffs on `Product`.

== Scope of Applicability
- The Java customization examples in this project should all be applicable to existing and new Broadleaf Microservices projects.
- The maven pom inheritance, maven profiles, run commands, etc... are not currently applicable to existing or new Broadleaf Microservices projects - although advances here will eventually be brought over to real dev projects in the future.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The concept projects require recent versions of several Broadleaf Framework libraries
====

----
- Leveraging the code patterns and components demonstrated in the concept projects requires recent versions of several Broadleaf Framework libraries. You should set these versions (or newer) at the top of the `dependencyManagement` section of your root pom in your own project before attempting to reproduce or compile against the patterns shown here. If your release train reference is advanced enough to bring these versions (or newer) in by default, then you can skip explicitly declaring them here.

== Roadmap
- This project represents an ongoing effort to document customization use cases and patterns.
- We will continue to add new concepts as they come up.
- If a new concept requires a framework change or enhancement (e.g. a change to one or more of the libraries above), we will increment the version of this concept project along with noting the version change(s) to the associated common framework libraries.
- Training will also be developed based on these concept materials and will be available separately.
