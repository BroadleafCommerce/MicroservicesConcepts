R &amp; D around various extension and dev use cases. Proving ground for concepts.

- The idea is to create various demo projects that showcase a vision for the simplest path to achieve a dev goal. The goal will be clearly stated in each demo project. Some demo projects will be deeper riffs on concepts from other projects (e.g. simple domain extension in one project, then another project with the same domain extension and additional repository extension).
- The demo project structure will be simple. Min flexpackage alone will be generally favored, avoiding balanced and granular bloat.
- Will consume framework and demo artifacts from the latest relevant develop branches.
